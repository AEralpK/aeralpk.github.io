# About


This website is dedicated to my wonderful wife, the loving mother of our fur-baby Spooky, in celebration of her 30th birthday!

Of the 30 amazing years you’ve graced this world, I’ve been lucky to be part of the last four. Without you, my love, there’s no sunshine in my life. There are countless reasons why I adore you, but here are just a few:

- The way you love us both unconditionally and always go above and beyond to make us happy.
- Watching your happy dance, especially when you’re eating something delicious.
- Your incredible creativity and the beautiful ways you express it.
- How you make me laugh, sometimes so hard that my stomach hurts.
- Your amazing empathy and thoughtfulness, always considering others’ feelings.
- The magic you work in the kitchen—your cooking is legendary.
- Your 10/10 looks that never cease to take my breath away.
- How you’re adorably messy, yet get mad when things are messy around you.
- How strong you are.
- How you have managed to go through tortures and were able to find happiness even then.
- How you make me feel loved.
- How you always tell me right away when you do a small boo boo.

It is easy to write reasons but have to stop somewhere. No matter what challenges come our way, we always face them together. There’s no obstacle we can’t overcome when we’re united. May we never be apart and continue to grow and thrive as a together.

From our unforgettable trip to Maui or Finland or to our quiet movie nights at home, every moment with you is a treasure. Making new memories with you is my favorite hobby, where a laugh, some exhilaration, and fun are guaranteed, that has taken over all others.

I can’t wait to see what the next chapter holds for us. More adventures, more laughs, and more love. I will always love and be in awe of your creativity, your ability to find the silver lining, your resourcefulness, you.

Happy 30th birthday, my love. Here’s to many more years of joy and laughter together!
